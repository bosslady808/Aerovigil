**Predictive Fatigue Risk Analytics for Aviation Safety**

---

## AeroVigil Dashboard Preview

AeroVigil is an aviation fatigue risk analytics platform designed to support airline operations with predictive insights, crew risk monitoring, and decision-support tools.

### Key Features
- Real-time fatigue risk scoring
- 7-day fatigue trend forecasting
- Scenario simulation for schedule optimization
- Multi-crew risk monitoring dashboard
- IROPs (disruption) mode

## Overview

Fatigue remains one of the most critical human factors challenges in aviation safety. AeroVigil explores how operational inputs from crew scheduling and duty periods can be transformed into a clear, interpretable **fatigue risk score**.

This prototype demonstrates how predictive analytics can support airline operations by identifying fatigue risk **before flights operate**, enabling proactive safety decisions.

---

## Core Features

- Fatigue risk scoring (0–100 scale)
- Risk classification:
  - LOW
  - MODERATE
  - HIGH
- Real-time mitigation recommendations
- 7-day fatigue trend forecasting
- Scenario simulation for schedule adjustments
- Multi-crew risk table using CSV data
- IROPs (Irregular Operations) fatigue modeling
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit

---

## How It Works

The fatigue model evaluates key operational inputs:

- Duty hours  
- Flight segments  
- Time zone changes  
- Rest hours before duty  
- Circadian disruption  

Each factor contributes to a weighted fatigue score, which is normalized to a **0–100 risk scale**.

## Vision

AeroVigil represents an early-stage concept for predictive aviation safety analytics.

The long-term goal is to help aviation organizations transition from reactive fatigue management to proactive, data-driven risk prediction, supporting both operational decision-making and safety systems such as SMS and FRMS.
