AeroVigil is a prototype aviation safety tool designed to estimate **crew fatigue risk** using key operational factors such as duty hours, flight segments, time zone changes, rest periods, and circadian disruption.

This project was built as an early proof-of-concept for a larger vision: helping airlines and aviation safety teams identify fatigue risk **before flights operate**.

# 2. Overview

Fatigue remains one of the most critical human factors issues in aviation safety. AeroVigil explores how operational inputs from crew scheduling and duty periods can be converted into a clear **fatigue risk score**.

This prototype allows users to experiment with different operational scenarios and instantly see how fatigue risk changes.

---

# 3. Features

- Calculates a **fatigue risk score** from 0–100
- Uses operational inputs such as:
  - Duty hours
  - Flight segments
  - Time zone changes
  - Rest hours before duty
  - Circadian disruption
- Displays a fatigue **classification level**
  - LOW
  - MODERATE
  - HIGH
- Provides a **mitigation recommendation**
- Includes a **scenario comparison chart**
- Includes a **4-day fatigue trend / timeline predictor**
- Built with an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**

---

# 4. How It Works

The fatigue calculator assigns weighted values to operational risk factors:

- Longer duty periods increase fatigue risk
- More flight segments increase workload
- Crossing time zones increases disruption
- Greater circadian disruption increases fatigue likelihood
- More rest before duty lowers fatigue risk

The total is converted into a capped score from **0–100**, making it easier to understand risk severity.

10. Vision
AeroVigil is more than a calculator — it represents the beginning of a broader aviation safety concept focused on predictive fatigue analytics.
The long-term vision is to build tools that help aviation organizations move from reacting to fatigue events to predicting and preventing fatigue risk before it impacts safety.
Future versions of AeroVigil could support airline Safety Management Systems (SMS) and Fatigue Risk Management Systems (FRMS) through predictive analytics and operational risk visualization.
